        Hi, I'm <b>Sulaimon Olalekan Ekundayo</b>. I have a diverse background, starting with studies in Accounting, Business
        Management, and Finance, before making a transition into the world of IT. Initially, I worked as a Software QA
        Engineer, where I gained a strong understanding of quality assurance practices and testing methodologies.
        <br><br>
        Currently, I am focused on my journey to become a full-stack developer, diving deep into technologies like
        Node.js, Express.js, React, and more. I enjoy blending my analytical skills with coding to solve complex
        problems, and I’m always eager to learn and grow in the ever-evolving tech landscape. My unique journey has
        equipped me with a broad perspective, which I apply to both development and problem-solving. 
        <br><br>
        In addition to my technical interests, I have a strong passion for agriculture, particularly in crops and animal husbandry. I enjoy
        reading and learning more about the agricultural industry, which often inspires my creativity and drive for
        continuous learning. Explore my portfolio to see the projects I’ve worked on as I continue my transition into
        the world of full-stack development.
